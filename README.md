Overview

This C++ program identifies the two longest concatenated words from a given list. Using dynamic programming, it checks if a word can be formed by concatenating others. The program then sorts the concatenated words by length, printing the two longest words.

Steps to Execute

1. Initialize Variables:**
   - Import necessary libraries (`#include <bits/stdc++.h>`).
   - Define macros for long long and modulo.

2. Define Custom Comparator:
   - Implement a static compare function to compare string lengths.

3. Word Break Function (`wordBreak`):
   - Define a function to check if a given word can be broken into smaller words from a provided dictionary.

4. Dynamic Programming Initialization:
   - Create a dynamic programming vector `dp` of size `(s.length() + 1)` initialized to `false`.

5. Process Dictionary:
   - Iterate through the given list of words and populate an unordered map (`m`) with word frequencies.

6. Concatenated Words Identification:
   - Iterate through the list of words.
   - Use the `wordBreak` function to check if each word can be formed by concatenating other words.
   - Store the concatenated words in a vector (`ans`).

7. Sorting of Concatenated Words:
   - Sort the `ans` vector based on string length using the custom comparator.

8. Output the Results:
   - Print the two longest concatenated words from the sorted vector.

9. Execution Time Measurement:
   - Record the start time using the `chrono` library.
   - After the program execution, record the end time and calculate the elapsed time in milliseconds.

### Note:
- Ensure that the input file (`Input_01.txt`) contains the list of words.
- Modify file names and settings for different inputs or outputs based on the comments in the code.
- The program outputs the two longest concatenated words and the execution time in milliseconds.

The program utilizes dynamic programming to efficiently identify concatenated words and employs a custom comparator for sorting.
